Mouse and human: percentage_identity=89.64%         alignment score=1091
Mouse and random sequence: percentage_identity=5.86%          alignment score=-250
Human and random sequence: percentage_indentity=5.41%            alignment score=-250

Interpretation: 
the protein encoded by DNA at the same site in human and mouse are highly similar, which means that using
mouse as the major subject in our lab is reasonable to simulate human body.

Though indentical percentage of mouse and random sequence is different from that of human and sequence, their alignment 
scores are the same. Therefore, alignment score can ignore the tiny difference when comparing and just focus on general similarity.

The same alignment score of mouse and human towards the same random sequence, from another hand, indicates the similarity
of human gene and mouse gene. Also it implies the same ancestor who generates human and mouse eventually.
