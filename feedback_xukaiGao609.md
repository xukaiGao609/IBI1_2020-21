For practical of week 4
I have changed the commit messages to the more informative ones by commiting files again, I add "edited" before the "thingsIlike.txt", add "update" before the "reflection.txt"......

For Practical of week 5
first I managed to print the result such as "d is bigger than e"
then I rename my collatz.py to fibonacci.py
finally I described the mystery_code in a more detailed and accurate way.

For practical of week 6
I add a title in my pile chart
I correct my pseudocode which explains plt.axis('equal') to a more accurate one that to make sure the pie chart is a standard cycle instead of a ellipse.
